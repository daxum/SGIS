# SGIS
A simple game involving squares - because names are hard.

This project makes extensive use of [SGIS-Engine](https://github.com/daxum/SGIS-Engine).

For build instructions, first see CMakeLists.txt for engine instructions, then do `./project setup build release`.

If you're on Windows, you _might_ be able to build it by doing `cmake .` and the `make` inside the source directory. Maybe.

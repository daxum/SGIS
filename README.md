# SGIS
A simple game involving squares - because names are hard.

This is the game as it was before the engine was split out.

This project uses the following libraries:
* [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/)
* [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org)
* [stb_image.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
* [glm](https://glm.g-truc.net)
* [Assimp](http://assimp.org)

In addition, the files `gl_core_4_1.h` and `gl_core_4_1.c` were automatically generated by [glLoadGen](https://bitbucket.org/alfonse/glloadgen/wiki/Home), and then slightly modified.
